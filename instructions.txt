This zip file contains the code to run our experiments described in our paper. 

The /data folder contains the the raw data of both the UCI datasets and synthetic datasets. The folder also contains the code to
retrieve and preprocess the code before training the model.

The /models folder contains the code for all four of the models in our experiment, even our proposed model XGBoost+.

To run any of the experiments, please run the following command:

`python3 main.py {modelName} {datasetName}`

Options for {modelName} (case sensitive):
- SVM
- SVM+
- XGB
- XGB+

Options for {datasetName} (caseSensitive):
- wine
- abalone
- cancer
- diabetes
- synth1
- synth2
- synth3
- synth4

The command will run the specified model using the specified dataset over 50 independent trials and produce the
indivdual trial results and averaged results as well.
